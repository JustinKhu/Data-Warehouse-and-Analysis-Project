# Data-Warehouse-and-Analysis-Project
# Data Warehouse Project

## 📖 Overview
This project is an end-to-end **data warehouse build** that I created to strengthen my data analytics skills. 
The aim is to simulate a real-world data workflow — starting with **raw data ingestion**, then **cleaning and transformation**, and ending with a **star-schema model** ready for reporting and analysis.

Therefore, improving my knowledge and skills in data. This project will also be something I can work on in the future as I continue to accumulate more skills.

## 🧭 Objectives
- Practicing designing and implementing a **data warehouse architecture** using SQL-based technologies.
- Import data from two sources (CRM and ERP) as CSV files. 
- Apply **ETL** to transform raw data into analytics-ready form.
- Clean and standardize raw data for easy analysis. 
- Combine both data sources into one data model to be used for analytical queries. 
- Provide clear and easy to understand documentation.

 ## Author

My name is Justin Khu, I'm an aspiring data analyst with growing interest in data analytics. 

I made this project to apply what I’ve learned in SQL and data modelling, — and to keep improving my ability to turn raw data into clear, usable insights.
